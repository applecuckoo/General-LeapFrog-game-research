# Sunplus
This section is specifically for common formats on SPG/SPC-based LeapFrog products. This includes Generalplus stuff too.

Format list:

- A16 (Sunplus A1600 Codec)
- S72 (Sunplus S720 Codec)
- A18 (Generalplus A1800 Codec)
- SunMIDI

You'll need to get the algorithm libraries from the [Generalplus Gadget Utility](http://www.generalplus.com/1LVlangLNxxSVyySNservice_n_support_d) to use the conversion script.
