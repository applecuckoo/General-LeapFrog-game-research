# Sunplus
This section is specifically for common formats on SPG/SPC-based LeapFrog products. This includes Generalplus stuff too.

LeapFrog started using SPG-based hardware before the Didj came out and the formats they used on them have remained mostly the same over the years.

Format list:

- A16 (Sunplus A1600 Codec)
- S72 (Sunplus S720 Codec)
- A18 (Generalplus A1800 Codec)
- SunMIDI

You'll need to get the algorithm libraries from the [Generalplus Gadget Utility](http://www.generalplus.com/1LVlangLNxxSVyySNservice_n_support_d) to use the conversion script.

Your Python version also has to be 32-Bit.

Special thanks to the Furby hacking community for figuring out how to use the A1800 codec!
