# LeapFrog Enterprises
This section is for any formats developed by (or in collaboration with) LeapFrog.

### What is "Pre-Pollux"?
Anything that came before the Didj or reuses formats from a system that came before the Didj.

### What is "Pollux and NXP"?
Any Linux-based LeapFrog handheld ranging from the Didj in 2008 to the LeapPad Jr. in 2018.

### What is "Utilities"?
This section is for tools that might be useful for preservation but aren't exactly for reverse engineering.

Think of stuff like screen recording and screenshots.

### How do we know if something is proprietary and more importantly, made by LeapFrog?
If the format is generally unknown online and only appears on LeapFrog products, it's able to be considered proprietary. 

File extensions **DO NOT** matter, only the contents of the files! 

#### Examples:
A file with the extension ".bin" might exist in one program but will generally have a completely different structure and purpose in another. ".bin" is a very generic extension and as such you might want to identify files by their file signature instead.

I found a program that uses a ".syn" extension, but it's 100% unrelated to the LeapFrog format.
