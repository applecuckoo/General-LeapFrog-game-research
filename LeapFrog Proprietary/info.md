### What is "Pre-Pollux"?
Anything that came before the Didj.

### How do we know if something is proprietary and more importantly, made by LeapFrog?
If the format is generally unknown online and only appears on LeapFrog products, it's able to be considered proprietary. 

File extensions **DO NOT** matter, only the contents of the files! 

#### Examples:
A file with the extension ".bin" might exist in one program but will generally have a completely different structure and purpose in another.

I found a program that uses a ".syn" extension, but it's 100% unrelated to the LeapFrog format.
