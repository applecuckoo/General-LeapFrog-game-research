# 1st Playable Productions file types

- fs.arc - zlib compressed archive. Interestingly, this archive contains hidden Nintendo DS-related text.
- game-rio.rdt - another resources archive? A load of zlib-compressed assets definitely exist here, but it's hard to sort through without any file names or file hierarchy.
